# TrekTracker - the personal tracking app

TrekTracker is a personal tracking app for tracking things like hikes, trail rides, and geocaching. It stores your Treks locally, with the
option of encrypted cloud backups. 


## TODOs
 - Cloud functionality
 - UI improvements 
 - Options menu 
 - More reasonable code organisation (adhere to MVVM properly)
 - Unit testing
